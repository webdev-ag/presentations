#### Solution

<div style="font-size:0.6666em">

- **One Sourcecode:**<!-- .element class="blue" -->
  We keep the code always in a so called "repository"<!-- .element class="red" -->. It is online accessible to all developers

- **New Features:**<!-- .element class="green" -->
  Everey Time we start working on a feature, we create a copy of the repo where we start working
  on the feature. This is called a `branch`<!-- .element class="red" -->

- **Rollback to a older version?**<!-- .element class="yellow" -->
  Everytime we change something we `commit`<!-- .element class="red" --> it to the repository.
  If something is broken, we can go back to the commit we want

</div>

These are the features of a<br/>
`Version Control System`<!-- .element class="red" -->
